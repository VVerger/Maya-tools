Sanity cheker for maya 
Can check and fix : 
- if the render camera isn't set on a starter camera 
- if the format isn't on default (540) and put it on 1920x1080
- if the engine is set on renderman 
- if there is duplicate name 
- if there is no base name (pCube, pSphere, etc)
- if the subdiv scheme is activated

to make the code work you have to change the ui path in the main.py
